What is Cloud Computing ?
# Cloud Computing Overview

Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and use computing resources (such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence) over the internet, commonly referred to as "the cloud." These resources are hosted and provided by third-party providers in data centers.

## Key Concepts:

### 1. Service Models:

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
  
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the complexities of infrastructure.

- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.

### 2. Deployment Models:

- **Public Cloud:** Resources are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, and services are delivered over the internet.

- **Private Cloud:** Resources are used exclusively by one business or organization, and infrastructure is maintained either on-premises or by a third-party provider.

- **Hybrid Cloud:** A combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing:

1. **Cost Efficiency:** Pay only for the resources you use, avoiding upfront infrastructure costs.

2. **Scalability:** Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.

3. **Flexibility:** Access resources and data from anywhere with an internet connection.

4. **Reliability:** Cloud providers often have redundant systems, ensuring high availability and reliability.

5. **Security:** Cloud providers invest heavily in security measures, often providing more robust security than individual organizations can afford.
